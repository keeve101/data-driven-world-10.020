## Food Security Indicator Estimator Model (1d-project)
There is a growing need to be able to comprehensively measure and assess food security, to be able to address and mend areas of food insecurity. As per our findings, multiple indexes of food insecurity and hunger exist online such as the Global Hunger Index, The FAO Food Price Index, and more. These are various methods to gauge a country's food security, and they usually take many variables and are highly complicated to derive. This process is time-consuming and expensive, taking up resources that can be allocated into actual solutions.

Hence, building upon pre-existing indices that have proven useful over the years through robust and comprehensive methodology, we intend to train a Linear Regression model to be able to swiftly estimate a country's level of food security with features that encompass the four main dimensions.
